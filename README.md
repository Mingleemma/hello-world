# hello-world
My first go on github. The conventional hello-world a programmer works on for the very first time he codes. So this is my first repository and it stands in the like fashion of HELLO WORLD.
To tell a little about myself, so far I am coding in C++ and would be jumping on to other languages soon. Thinking of Java and maybe add a bit of HTML(all the web design language family too.)
